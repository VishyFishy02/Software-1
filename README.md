My java projects I coded during Software 1 These projects foucused on various object oriented programming concepts and mainly developed
problem solving skills:

project 1: Exposure to HTML, CSS and markup sytle languages by creating a custom home page
project 2: Worked with java, doubles, loops, and static methods.
project 3: worked with nested loops
project 4: created a program that scans rss websites and creates an XML tree object
project 5: built upon project 4 so that it reads multple RSS feeds and generates an HTML page with links to each feed
project 6: worked with objects called natural numbers and applied mathmatical concept of interval halving to inverse funcitons
project 7: Worked with recursion to evaulte mathmatical expressions, XMLTree objects, and NaturalNumber objects
project 8: A cryptography fousced project with Naturla number objects, and exposure to design by testing and JUnit
project 9: A glossary project designed by me which exposed me to object oriented progrmaming designg from the gorund up, clever problem solving, and HTML
