# Software-1
My java projects I coded during Software 1 These projects foucused on various object oriented programming concepts and mainly developed
problem solving skills:


| Project     | objective/outcome      | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| 1          | Exposure to HTML, CSS and markup sytle languages by creating a custom home page         | 
| 2           | Worked with java, doubles, loops, and static methods         | 
| 3           | worked with nested loops         | 
| 4           | created a program that scans rss websites and creates an XML tree object         | 
| 5           | built upon project 4 so that it reads multple RSS feeds and generates an HTML page with links to each feed         | 
| 6           | worked with objects called natural numbers and applied mathmatical concept of interval halving to inverse funcitons         | 
| 7           | Worked with recursion to evaulte mathmatical expressions, XMLTree objects, and NaturalNumber objects         | 
| 8           | A cryptography fousced project with Naturla number objects, and exposure to design by testing and JUnit        | 
| 9           | A glossary project designed by me which exposed me to object oriented progrmaming designg from the gorund up, clever problem solving, and HTML         |
